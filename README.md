# Float Mind

## Inspiration

In our fast-paced world, stress and emotional disconnect are widespread. To address this, we explored how new technologies could help individuals relax and recharge quickly. Inspired by mindfulness and visual-based meditation, our team developed a gamified meditation approach. This helps users relax their bodies and minds while visualizing and overcoming emotional challenges. Our solution blends gamification, AR/VR, and AI to make mental wellness practices more engaging and impactful.

## What it does

**Float Mind** is an AI-powered AR/VR meditation tool designed to help stressed individuals effectively relax and reconnect with their emotions through an immersive mindfulness experience. With a seamless, controller-free interface on Meta Quest, it offers a unique combination of AI-driven emotional insights and interactive meditation practices.
The experience begins with Flo, an empathetic AI companion that analyzes users’ thoughts and visualizes their positive and negative emotions as interactive 3D bubbles. Through intuitive hand gestures, users engage with these bubbles, dynamically shaping their virtual environment. This transitions seamlessly into a guided meditation phase, where calming breathing exercises, soothing animations, and interactive elements like growing auroras and nurturing trees promote mindfulness and relaxation.

## Why it matters

**Float Mind** integrates cutting-edge AI with immersive technology to redefine traditional mindfulness practices. It provides a trusted, science-backed mental wellness solution, offering busy professionals an accessible and impactful way to manage stress and enhance emotional well-being, whether at work or at home.

## How we built it

**Float Mind** was developed using Meta Quest, Unity, and advanced AI technologies. The emotional analysis feature leverages natural language processing to detect positivity and negativity in user input, while the AR/VR experience was crafted using Unity’s XR Toolkit. Our team combined expertise in AI, UI/UX design, and immersive 3D environments to create a seamless and engaging user journey. Rigorous testing ensured the interactivity and flow worked smoothly without the need for controllers.
